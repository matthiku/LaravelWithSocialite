## Laravel Socialite in Action!

### Sample, educational TaskManager App based on Laravel 5.1 with the built-in local and Socialite authorization fully implemented.

It currently works with Github, Facebook, Google, Twitter and LinkedIn.

As Twitter does not return the user's email address by default (only after you ask them to whitelist your app), a fake email address is being created by using the users's Twitter nickname and 'twitter.com', e.g. 'blahdibla@twitter.com'.
